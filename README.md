Los Angeles, California ðŸ˜Ž. The City of Angels. Tinseltown. The Entertainment Capital of the World!

Known for its warm weather, palm trees, sprawling coastline, and Hollywood, along with producing some of the most iconic films and songs. However, as with any highly populated city, it isn't always glamorous and there can be a large volume of crime. That's where you can help!

You have been asked to support the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) by analyzing crime data to identify patterns in criminal behavior. They plan to use your insights to allocate resources effectively to tackle various crimes in different areas.

#### Find:

##### 1. Which hour has the highest frequency of crimes?

Store as an integer variable called peak_crime_hour.

##### 2. Which area has the largest frequency of night crimes (crimes committed between 10pm and 3:59am)?

Save as a string variable called peak_night_crime_location.

##### 3. Identify the number of crimes committed against victims of different age groups.

Save as a pandas Series called victim_ages, with age group labels "0-17", "18-25", "26-34", "35-44", "45-54", "55-64", and "65+" as the index and the frequency of crimes as the values.
